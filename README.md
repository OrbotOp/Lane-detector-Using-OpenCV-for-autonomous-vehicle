# Lane-detector-Using-OpenCV-for-autonomous-vehicle
## Project description
Autonomous Driving Car represents a significant AI innovation. One crucial step in training these cars is lane detection, ensuring they stay on the correct path and avoid crossing into other lanes. Lane recognition algorithms analyze visual input to reliably identify lane locations and borders. They play a crucial role in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. Today, we'll discuss one of these lane detection algorithms.

## File information

1. lane_detection_img - performs lane detection on image from the dataset
2. lane_detector_live - performs lane detection in real time using camera

I have provided readme file in each of these program how to run it.
